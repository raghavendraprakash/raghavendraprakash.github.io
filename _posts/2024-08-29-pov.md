Microsoft has an exclusive partnership with OpenAI, Google has Gemini. Anthropic Claude is a strong contender for OpenAI's GPT models. And there is LlaMA from Meta. While Amazon has partnership with Anthropic, their models are available on other cloud service providers as well. With so much happening around Generative AI, does having no serious home grown LLM from Amazon hurt the cloud giant in a long run?

A company may strategise its position in a highly competetive and evolving Generative AI market as a connector with multiple model choices. I tend to think the other way. Shouldn't a company back or partner strongly and exclusively for it's own brand and establish it as a defacto service?

Hmm... Generative AI is a double edged sword, can cut in both the ways!
